# Content Management

This application appears to use a structured approach to content management:

## Content Structure

- [src/content](mdc:src/content) - Contains content files and data structures
- [src/mdx-components.ts](mdc:src/mdx-components.ts) - MDX component customization

## Implementation

The application likely uses MDX for rich content with React components. The `mdx-components.ts` file provides custom components used within markdown content, enhancing the capabilities of standard markdown.

Content may be organized by type, language, or other categorizations within the content directory structure.
